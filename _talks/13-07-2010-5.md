Hybrid exchange density functional theory is used to study the wide band gap chalcopyrite CuAlS2. 
The formation energies of charged and neutral intrinsic defects are calculated for different environmental 
conditions, and it is shown that CuAlS2 is a p-type material that cannot be type inverted through the 
formation of intrinsic defects. The calculated band gap states associated with the different intrinsic defects 
are used to comment on the origin of the observed CuAlS2CuAlS2 photoluminescence emissions. The origin and 
stability of ordered defect compounds derived from CuAlS2CuAlS2 are investigated,
and it is concluded that CuAl5S8CuAl5S8 is a stable ordered defect compound, albeit in a small region of phase space.

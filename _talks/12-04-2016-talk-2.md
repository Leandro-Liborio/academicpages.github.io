As an alumni of Queenâ€™s University Belfast - where I did my PhD in Theoretical Physics - who has had an somehow varied experience after his PhD, I was invited to tell my story during the 2016 Careers day.  I told them my story to this current point, when I am working as a Computational Scientist in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  I described the different stages of my professional life: PhD in Theoretical Physics; Researcher at Imperial College London, Patent assistant in two Intellectual Property Law firms.  

I told the story of my 360 degrees turn in my professional life: I went into academia after my PhD, then I decided to leave and worked in Patent Law and, after that, I came back into the academic life, where I am now.

excerpt: 'In this work, I discussed the computational methods that we had developed so far to estimate the muon stopping
site in crystalline materials. The key new concept is the development of methods based on calculations other than ab-initio calculations.  The idea is that the new calculations are computationally faster than the purely ab initio ones.  One of the methods that I have tested is the DFT-based Tight-Binding.'

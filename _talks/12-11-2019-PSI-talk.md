location: "Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland"
excerpt: 'This was a seminar that I gave during my visit to the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI),
which hosts one of the two muon sources in Europe. The visit was part of my Software 
Sustainability Institute's fellowship.  In the seminar, I presented the computational 
models and associated tools that are being developed at the Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory (RAL), and discussed some potential avenues for collaborative work,
centred on muon software development, between PSI and RAL.'

The phase stability of LaMnO3 with respect to its competing oxides is studied using hybrid-exchange density
functional theory (DFT) as implemented in CRYSTAL09. The underpinning DFT total-energy calculations are
embedded in a thermodynamic framework that takes optimal advantage of error cancellation within DFT. It has
been found that by using the ab initio thermodynamic techniques described here, the standard Gibbs formation
energies can be calculated to a significantly greater accuracy than was previously reported (a mean error of
1.6% with a maximum individual error of âˆ’3.0%). This is attributed to both the methodology for isolating
the chemical potentials of the reference states, as well as the use of the Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr
(B3LYP) functional to thoroughly investigate the ground-state energetics of the competing oxides

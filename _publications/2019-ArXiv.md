title: "Comparison between Density Functional Theory and Density Functional Tight Binding approaches
for finding the muon stopping site in organic molecular crystals"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'The stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment (mu+SR) is generally unknown and there
few techniques that can be used to determine the muon stopping site. In this work, we compare the accuracy and computational
costs of two purely theoretical methods that can be used to predict muon stopping sites in organiccrystalline materials 
using only computer simulations.'

Finding the possible stopping sites for muons inside a crystalline sample is a key problem of muon spectroscopy. In a 
previous work, we suggested a computational approach to this problem, using Density Functional Theory software in 
combination with a random structure searching approach using a Poisson sphere distribution.
In this work we test this methodology further by applying it to three organic molecular crystals model systems: durene, 
bithiophene, and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Using the same sets of random structures we compare the performance of
Density Functional Theory software CASTEP and the much faster lower level approximation of Density Functional Tight 
Binding provided by DFTB+, combined with the use of the 3ob-3-1 parameter set. We show the benefits and limitations of such
an approach and we propose the use of DFTB+ as a viable alternative to more cumbersome simulations for routine site-finding
in organic materials. Finally, we introduce the Muon Spectroscopy Computational Project software suite, a library of Python tools meant 
to make these methods standardized and easy to use.

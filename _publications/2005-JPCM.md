We performed first-principles calculations to study the stability
of different Sr adatom structures that have been proposed to explain some of
the observed reconstructions of the (001) surface of strontium titanate (Kubo
and Nozoye 2003 Surf. Sci. 542 177). From surface free energy calculations, we
constructed a phase diagram indicating the range of environmental conditions over which
each surface reconstruction is stable. We compared these results with Kubo and
Nozoyeâ€™s experimental observations, and concluded that low Sr adatom
coverage structures can only be explained if the surface is far from equilibrium.
Intermediate coverage structures are stable only if the surface is in or very nearly
in equilibrium with the strontium oxide.

We used hybrid exchange density functional theory to study the wide band gap chalcopyrite CuAlS2.
The formation energies of charged and neutral intrinsic defects are calculated for different
environmental conditions, and it is shown that CuAlS2 is a p-type material that cannot be type
inverted through the formation of intrinsic defects. The calculated band gap states associated with
the different intrinsic defects are used to comment on the origin of the observed CuAlS2
photoluminescence emissions. The origin and stability of ordered defect compounds derived from
CuAlS2 are investigated, and it is concluded that CuAl5S8 is a stable ordered defect compound,
albeit in a small region of phase space.

The longitudinal field Avoided Level Crossing (ALC) muon spectrum of crystalline benzene, which is found to exhibit multiple complex features that strongly depend on temperature. In this work, we used a number of different computational techniques in conjunction to explain this behavior. An overall picture emerges in which the spectrum appears to be the result of an interplay of multiple dynamical effects, both classical and quantum mechanical.

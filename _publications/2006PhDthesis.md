The scope of this thesis covers the study of the atomic scale models that were proposed to understand the surface
reconstructions that have been observed on SrTiO3(001). These atomic scale models were investigated using first principles
total energy calculations. Two newly proposed models for SrTiO3(001) were studied: the so called Sr adatom model and the 
double layer model. In particular, I have focused on the models proposed to explain the (2×1) and c(4×2) reconstructions 
on SrTiO3(001), and on the set of surface phase transitions observed by Kubo and Nozoye on SrTiO3(001).

To achieve this goal, I have used first principles atomic scale thermodynamics. This tech- nique links concepts and 
techniques from thermodynamics with results obtained from atomistic electronic structure theory. Since most of the
experimental evidence comes from Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM), I have complemented the analysis with simulations
of the observed STM images for different surface reconstructions.

The results for the set of surface phase transitions observed by Kubo and Nozoye show that the lower Sr coverage implied
in the Sr adatom model can only be explained if the surface is far from equilibrium, in a transient state as it loses Sr
to the environment. Depending on the values of the environmental variables, stable atomic scale models were found for the
(2×1) and c(4×2) reconstructions.

We used hybrid exchange density functional theory is to study the wide band gap chalcopyrite CuGaSe2. The formation
energies of the experimentally observed (4 × 1) and (1 × 1) atomic scale reconstructions on the
CuGaSe2 (001) surface are calculated for different environmental conditions. The results suggest that a Se-rich
(1 ×1) reconstruction, and a Cu-poor, Se-rich (4 × 1) reconstruction, are the only stable surfaces under
all the studied environmental conditions. Two complementary mechanisms for the stabilisation of CuGaSe2
surfaces are proposed, and it is suggested that the presence of Na stabilises the (4 × 1) reconstructions, making
them the stable terminations under Na-rich conditions.
